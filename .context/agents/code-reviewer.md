# Code Reviewer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Describe how the code reviewer agent supports the team and when to engage it.

## Responsibilities
- Review code changes for quality, style, and best practices
- Identify potential bugs and security issues
- Ensure code follows project conventions
- Provide constructive feedback and suggestions

## Best Practices
- Focus on maintainability and readability
- Consider the broader impact of changes
- Be constructive and specific in feedback

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `projeto/` — The main project directory containing the source code, configuration files, and other core assets for the application.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Aim for 100% of pull requests reviewed within 24 hours and identify at least one improvement suggestion per review to enhance code quality.
- Use repository analytics tools (e.g., GitHub Insights) to track review turnaround times and bug introduction rates quarterly, targeting a 20% reduction in post-merge bugs.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

### Issue: Inconsistent Code Style in Pull Requests
**Symptoms:** Linting errors or formatting issues flagged during review
**Root Cause:** Contributors not using the project's linting or formatting tools
**Resolution:**
1. Check if pre-commit hooks are enabled in the repository
2. Suggest running `npm run lint` or equivalent before submission
3. Provide links to the tooling guide for setup instructions
**Prevention:** Enforce CI checks for style compliance and include setup in the contributor guide

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
