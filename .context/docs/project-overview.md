# Project Overview

> The GarageInn project is an early-stage initiative focused on developing a web-based application for garage management. It solves the problem of inefficient scheduling, customer booking, and service tracking in automotive repair shops. Beneficiaries include garage owners (for streamlined operations), mechanics (for better task assignment), and customers (for easy reservations and updates).

## Quick Facts
- Root path: `C:\Users\Anderson Domingos\Documents\Projetos\garageinn`
- Primary languages detected:
- Markdown (.md, 8 files) for documentation
- Images (.png and .ico, 2 files) for assets

## File Structure & Code Organization
- `design-system.md` — This Markdown file documents the design principles, UI components, color schemes, and typography guidelines to ensure consistent visual identity across the GarageInn application.
- `favicon.ico` — The icon file used as the favicon for the GarageInn web application, appearing in browser tabs, bookmarks, and mobile home screens.
- `logo-garageinn.png` — The primary logo image for the GarageInn project, utilized in the application's header, marketing materials, and branding elements.
- `projeto/` — The core directory housing the project's main components, including any source code, configuration files, and sub-documentation for development and implementation.

## Technology Stack Summary
- The project is in its initial documentation phase, with Markdown as the primary format for guides and overviews.
- No build tooling, linting, or formatting infrastructure is currently in place; future expansions may include Node.js-based tools for web development.

## Core Framework Stack
- N/A at this early stage; the project will likely adopt frontend frameworks like React for the UI and possibly Node.js/Express for backend services once implementation begins.
- Architectural patterns: To be defined, potentially including MVC for separation of concerns in the garage management logic.

## UI & Interaction Libraries
- UI guidelines are outlined in `design-system.md`, emphasizing responsive design, accessibility (WCAG compliance), and a clean, automotive-themed aesthetic.
- No specific libraries integrated yet; considerations include theming for dark/light modes and localization for multi-language support in customer-facing interfaces.

## Development Tools Overview
- Essential tools: Text editors like VS Code for Markdown editing; image viewers for asset review.
- For future code development: Git for version control and npm for package management (once `package.json` is introduced).
- Link to [Tooling & Productivity Guide](./tooling.md) for deeper setup instructions.

## Getting Started Checklist
1. Clone the repository from the source (e.g., GitHub if hosted).
2. Review documentation files starting with this overview and `design-system.md`.
3. Explore the `projeto/` directory for core assets and plan initial setup (e.g., initialize with `npm init` for web components).
4. Review [Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md) for day-to-day tasks.

## Next Steps
- Product positioning: GarageInn positions itself as a user-friendly SaaS platform for small to medium-sized automotive garages, focusing on digital transformation.
- Key stakeholders: Project lead (Anderson Domingos), development team, and potential end-users from the garage industry.
- External documentation: None available yet; monitor the repository for product specs and API references as they are added. Roadmap includes UI prototyping and backend integration.
